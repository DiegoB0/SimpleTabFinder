# Simple Tab Finder Chrome Extension

This Chrome extension helps you quickly find and switch between open tabs using a fuzzy search. It provides a modal window with a search bar where you can filter tabs by their title. You can navigate through the filtered results using keyboard shortcuts and select a tab to switch to it.

        Alt + K: Move up to the previous result.

- **Tab Switching:** Press Enter or click on a result to switch to that tab.

- **Focus:** The input field is automatically focused when the modal opens, so you can start typing immediately.

    2. Start typing to filter the list of open tabs.

    3. Use Alt + J to navigate down through the results and Alt + K to navigate up.
